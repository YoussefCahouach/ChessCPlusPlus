# ChessCPlusPlus


<div style="text-align: justify"> 
This project involves the development of a chess game in C++, featuring two modes of play: 1vs1 and replay. In the 1vs1 mode, players can engage in a traditional game of chess, matching their wits and strategy against each other. After the game is completed, players can activate the replay mode, where they can review all the moves made during the game. This feature provides a valuable tool for analyzing and improving oneâ€™s gameplay, allowing players to learn from their mistakes and refine their strategies. Activating the replay mode can be done in the main.cpp file.
